Scarpia
=======

Scarpia is a port of the http://legacy.cs.uu.nl/daan/parsec.html[Parsec] parser combinator library to Scala.

Parsec is an industrial-strength parser library. It is simple, safe, well documented, has extensive libraries and good error messages, and is also fast. It is defined as a monad transformer that can be stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric in the input stream type.

Scarpia is designed to be a faithful port of Parsec, while taking advantage of Scala features such as first-class modules.
